    <h1 class="fancyHeading">About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello my name is James Roberts, I am a young canadian guy who grew up in a small town in Ottawa Ontario Canada. It has taken me a while to find my career path but I have finally found it and I am super excited for whats in store in the future. I have worked many different career paths for example I have worked in landscaping, stone masonary, car rustproofing, and a few others. I have gained a lot of experience and knowledge on how to be proffesional as much as possible. Working in many different careers has given me the ability to not give up on a project or task no matter how tired I am. I have also gained the ability to communicate very well with my co-workers as I have also played competive basketball for five years. Playing competitive basketball and working construction based jobs gave me the ability to be resiliant and to work as hard as I can each and every day. I am very excited to learn how to be the best web developer I can be through my college course and will work on improving every because it would be super beneficial to know how to go through each step knowing what I am doing when I land a job.</p>
    <p>I may be young but through my early years of living life I have learn't how to be the best version of myself and to do so I need to keep working on self-improvement through every stage of my life. I can't wait to meet my future employer and I look forward to working on projects with whatever company hires me.</p>
